Smart Refrigerator Model for Food Safety and Health promotion using YOLOv10

According to the United Nations (UN), a significant amount of food waste comes from household refrigerators, necessitating a refrigerator that can detect food spoilage and monitor its contents. This research introduces a smart refrigerator model implementing YOLOv10 for object identification and quality monitoring of the stored food items based on the growing demand for food safety and health promotion. Most of the currently designed models of refrigerators are applying RFID or temperature monitoring alone, which fails to detect actual spoilage and provide overall guidelines to the user. Our model is built on economical, open-source hardware which couples a camera with multiple sensors to recognize food items, monitor its freshness, and liquid volume. The Android application will interact with this system, alerting users on items that need replenishment and giving dietary recommendations based on consumption patterns. This developed model provides a scalable and accessible approach with an accuracy of 97.5% to reduce food waste and promote health, both in household and healthcare applications.
